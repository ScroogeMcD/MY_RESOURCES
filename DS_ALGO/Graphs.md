# Graphs
## Some properties
### Connectivity
* A graph is **connected**, if there is a path between any two nodes.
* A graph may not be connected. In which case, different connected parts within the graph are called **components**.
* **Bipartite graph** : A graph is bi-partite if it is possible to split the nodes into two disjoint sets, such that each edge connects a node from one set, to another node from the other set.
* If it is possible to color a graph using two colors, such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color, then the graph is bipartite.
* A graph is bipartite exactly when it does not have a cycle with odd number of edges.
