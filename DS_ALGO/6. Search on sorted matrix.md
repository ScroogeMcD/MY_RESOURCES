# Searching in sorted matrix

**Problem statement** : Given a matrix where each row is sorted, and each column is sorted, find the location of an element in the matrix.
**Solution** :We can utilize the fact that the rows and the columns are sorted.

* **STEP 01** : start from top right cell
* **STEP 02** : If the element to be found is equal to this cell then return this cell.   
            Else if, the element to be found is smaller than this cell, discard the current column.   
            Else discard the current row.   
            
            Keep repeating this, until we have no more columns and rows left.
            
            
* **time complexity** : O(m+n), where m is no. of rows, and n is no. of cols
