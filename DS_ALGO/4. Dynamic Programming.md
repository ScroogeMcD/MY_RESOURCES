# Some Dynamic Programming Problems

## 1. Word Break Problem
**Problem** Given a sequence of characters, and a dictionary of words, find out if the sequence of words can be broken up to form a sentence, where each word is a part of the dictionary.   

**Solution** For an index i, the array[0,i] can be split into valid words from dictionary, if there exists an index **j < i** such the array can split up to j, and j+1 to i is a valid word in the dictionary.
