# Binary Indexed Tree

## Key Concepts
- The binary representation of each index of the array is considered. Hence the name **Binary Indexed** .
- In the Binary Indexed Tree, each cell of the tree is responsible for, or contains the cumulative frequencies of, **X** number of cells preceding and including the current cell.
- **X** here represents the number represented by the Least-Significant-One bit of the binary representation of the index.
- For ex, index 0110 would be responsible for 0010 (or 2) cells preceding and including itself.
- Another ex, index 1100 would be responsible for 0100 (or 4) cells preceding and including itself.
- To find the cumulative sum at a specific index, we would need to sum the cumulative frequencies at all those cells represented by the 1-bits of the index. 
  So if an index has three 1-bits sets, we will need to query three indices to find the total cumulative frequency.
  For ex, 
  |||
  |--|--|
  |cumulative freq at index 01101 | = cumulative freq at index 01101 |
  | | + cumulative freq at index 01100 |
  | | + cumulative freq at index 01000 |
  
- Notice that at each step above, we are removing the Least-Significant-One bit from the current Index, to find the prev index whose cumulative freq needs to be added. 
- How to efficiently find the number with just the Least-Significant-One bit set, for a given number k ?
  - ```Least-Significant-One(k) = k & (-k)```
  - For example : ```k=01100```, ```-k = 2's complement of k = scan from right, stop at first one, invert the rest = 10100```
  - Thus ```k & (-k) = 01100 & 10100 = 00100```
