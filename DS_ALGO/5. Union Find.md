# Union-Find

A **union-find structure** maintains a collection of sets. The sets are disjoint so no element belongs to more than one set. This structure supports two operations:   
* **union(x,y)** : union operation joins two sets, i.e. the sets to which **x** belongs is joined with the set to which **y** belongs. Two sets can be joined by connecting the representative of one set, to the representative of the other set.
* **find(x)** : find operation finds the representative of a set, to which the element **x** belongs

### Implementation
Union-find structure is represented using an array. Initially each element belongs to a set.

* initialization
```java
int length = 100;
int[] parent = new int[length];
int[] size = new int[length];
for(int i=0; i<length; i++){
  parent[i] = i;
  size[i] = 0;
}
```

* find
```java
int find(int x){
  while(parent[x] != x)
    x = parent[x];
  
  return x;
}
```

* union
```java
void union(int x, int y){
  int xOwner = find(x);
  int yOwner = find(y);
  
  if(size[xOwner] > size[yOwner]){
    parent[yOwner] = xOwner;
    size[xOwner] += size[yOwner];
  }else{
    parent[xOwner] = yOwner;
    size[yOwner] += size[xOwner];
  }
}
```

* same
```java
boolean same(int x, int y){
  return find(x) == find(y);
}
```
