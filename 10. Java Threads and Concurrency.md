## Memory regions
  * Heap (shared across threads)
    * Objects
    * Class members
    * Static Variables
  * Stack (separate for each thread)
    * local primitive types
    * local references

## Guarding critical section in JVM

* **synchronized** keyword
  * declare a method synchronized : Synchronized - monitor
    ```java
    public class ThreadTest {
      public synchronized void method1() {...}
      public synchronized void method2() {...}
    }
    ```
    Now if we create an object *obj1* of this class, and in two different threads *t1* and *t2*, try to invoke ```obj1.method1()``` and ```obj1.method2()```, 
    unless one thread exits say method1(), the other thread cannot enter method2(). This is because synchronized acquires lock at the object level.
* declare a block synchronized : Synchronized - block
  Here we first need to create an object to synchronize on, which will serve as a lock.
  ```java
  public class ClassWithCriticalSections{
    Object lockingObject = new Object();
    
    public void method1(){
      synchronized(lockingObject){
        // critical section
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  
  The synchronized method example given above is equivalent to the following synchronized block example :
  ```java
   public class ClassWithCriticalSections{
   
     public void method1(){
      synchronized(this){
        ...
      }
     }
     
     public void method2() {
      synchronized(this){
        ...
      }
     }
   }
  ```
  
  A synchronized block is **Reentrant**, i.e. a thread cannot prevent itself from entering a critical section. Ex.: 
  ```java
  public class ClassWithCriticalSections{
    public synchronized method1() {
      method2();
    }
    
    public synchronized method2() {
      ...
    }
  }
  ```
  In the above case, a thread T1 while accessing method1() can also enter method2() since it is already holding the lock.
  
  ## Atomic operations, volatile
  * all reference assignments are atomic
  * all assignments to primitive types are atomic, except *long* and *double*
  * Reading or writing to long and double values are not atomic. This is because it involves reading from or writing to first 32 bit, and then the second 32 bit.
  * Declaring a long or a double as **volatile** makes them atomic, because the JVM ensures that a write to a volatile field happens-before every subsequent read of that field.
  * **Data race** : Consider the following piece of code :
  ```java
  public class SharedClass {
   int x = 0;
   int y = 0;
   
   public void increment() {
    x++;
    y++;
   }
   
   public void checkForDataRace() {
    if(y > x){
     System.out.println("y > x detected. This should not be possible.");
    }
   }
  }
  ```
  In the above piece of code, even if ```incement()``` and ```checkForDataRace()``` are executed in two independent parallel threads, x can either be equal to y, or greater than y (in thread interleaving cases). This is what it seems to be apparently. However if we run the program, we might see the statement```y > x detected. This should not be possible.``` getting printed. This is because compiler and CPU can reorder instructions, where the logical correctness of the program is not changed. To prevent this data race, we can declare both ```x``` and ```y``` as ```volatile```. This will ensure that all instructions written before the volatile read/write in the code, will get executed before the volatile read/write, and won't be reordered beyond the volatile barrier. This is equivalent to a memory fence or memory barrier.
  ```java
  volatile int sharedVar;
  
  public void method() {
   ... // All instructions will be executed before
   read/write(sharedVar);
   ... // All instructions will be executed after
  }
  ```
  
  ## Locking Strategies and Deadlocks
  ```java
  Object lockNS; // lock NorthSouth
  Object lockEW; // lock EastWest
  
  void acquireNorthSouthRailTrack(){
    lock(lockNS);
    lock(lockEW);
    //.. pass train through the intersection
    release(lockEW);
    release(lockNS);
  }
  
  void acquireEastWestRailTrack(){
    lock(lockEw);
    lock(lockNS);
    //.. pass train through the intersection
    release(lockNS);
    release(lockEW);
  }
  ```
  |thread t1 acquire EW track| thread t2 acquire NS track| Comments |
  |--------------------------|---------------------------|----------|
  |lockEW|||
  ||lockNS||
  |lockNS|| t1 gets blocked here because t2 is holding NS lock|
  ||lockEW|t2 gets blocked here because t1 is holding the EW lock, thus causing a deadlock|
  
  **Conditions for a deadlock :**
  * **Mutual exclusion** - only one thread can have exclusive access to a resource
  * **Hold and wait** - At least one thread is holding a resource, and waiting for another resource.
  * **Non-preemptive allocation** - A resource cannot be released until the acquiring thread is done using it.
  * **Circular Wait** - A chain of at least two threads, each one is holding one resource and waiting for another resource.

  **Solutions for avoiding a deadlock**
  Ensure that at least one of the above 4 conditions do not satisfy.
  * **Avoid circular wait** - enforce a strict order in lock acquisition (In the above code, deadlock can be preventing by ensuring throughout the code, can first EW lock needs to be acquired, and only then the NW lock).
  
  **Other techniques**
  * **deadlock detection - watchdog** : a register that requires being update by every thread periodically. If this register does not get updated in certain interval, then a deadlock might have occurred
  * **Thread interruption** : (not possible with synchronized)
  * **tryLock operations**: (not possible with synchronized)

## Advanced Locking
### Reentrant lock
* works just like the synchronized keyword applied on an object
* requires explicit locking and unlocking

<table>
<tr><th>synchronized</th><th>reentrant lock</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
  
```java
Object lockObject = new Object();
Resource resource = new Resource();
...
...
public void method() {
  synchronized(lockObject) {
    ...
    useResource();
  }
}
```
    
</td>
<td>
    
```java
Lock lockObject = new ReentrantLock();
Resource resource = new Resource();
...
...
public void method() {
  lockObject.lock();
  ...
  useResource();
  lockObject.unlock();
}
```
    
</td>
</tr>
</table>

* Query methods - for testing
  * ```getQueuedThreads()``` - returns a list of threads waiting to acquire a lock
  * ```getOwner()``` - returns the thread that currently owns the lock
  * ```isHeldByCurrentThread()``` - Queries if the lock is held by the current thread
  * ```isLocked()``` - Queries if the lock is held by any thread

* Control over lock's fairness
  * by default, the Reentrant lock as well as the synchronized keyword do NOT guarantee any fairness
  * we can ensure fairness by passing true in the constructor ```new ReentrantLock(true)```

* ReentrantLock.lockInterruptibly()
  * forces us to handle InterruptedException. If a thread t1 is blocked waiting on a lock, and another thread interrupts t1, we can then handle the interrupt and perform any clean up required.
  * Use cases 
    * watchdog for deadlock detection and recovery
    * waking up threads to do clean and close the application

* ReentrantLock.tryLock()
  * if lock is available, acquires the lock and returns true
  * if the lock is unavailable, returns false, and does not get suspended


### ReentrantReadWriteLock
* Race Condition solution -> Mutual Exclusion i.e. regardless of operation (read/write/both), lock and allow only one thread in critical section.
* Multiple threads can read concurrently from a shared resource, as long as they are not modifying the state in any way.
* *Synchronized* and *ReentrantLock* do not allow multiple readers to access a shared resource concurrently.
```java
ReentrantReadWriteLock rwLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
Lock readLock = rwLock.readLock();
Lock writeLock = rwLock.writeLock();
```
<table>
<tr><th>write lock</th><th>read lock</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
  
```java
writeLock.lock();
try{
  modifySharedResources();
}finally{
  writeLock.unlock()
}
```
    
</td>
<td>
    
```java
readLock.lock();
try{
  readFromSharedResources();
}finally{
  readLock.unlock()
}
```
    
</td>
</tr>
</table>

* multiple threads are allowed to acquire a read lock simultaneously
* only a single thread can acquire a write lock
* There is mutualExclusion between readers and writers. If a write lock is acquired, no thread can acquire a read lock.

## Inter-Thread Communication
### Semaphores
* can be used to restrict the number of 'users' to a particular resource or a group of resources
* unlike locks that allow only one 'user' per resource
```java
Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(NUMBER_OF_PERMITS);
semaphore.acquire(); // NUMBER_OF_PERMITS - 1 now available
useResource();
semaphore.release();

semaphore.acquire(5); // NUMBER_OF_PERMITS - 5 now available
useResource();
semaphore.release(5);
```
* A lock can be thought of as a semaphore with only one permit to give.
* Semaphore - differences with locks
  * semaphores are not a great choice for locks
  * semaphore doesn't have a notion of owner thread
  * many threads can acquire a permit
  * the same thread can acquire the semaphore multiple times
  * The binary semaphore (initialized with 1) is **not reentrant**
  ```
  Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(1);
  
  void function1() {
   semaphore.acquire();
   semaphore.acquire(); // This will cause the thread to block, until some other thread released the semaphore, because semaphore is not reentrant
  }
  ```
  * Semaphore can be released by any thread, not just by the one that acquired it.

### Semaphores - Producer Consumer - one item
```java
Semaphore full = new Semaphore(0);
Semaphore empty = new Semaphore(1);
Item item = null;
```

<table>
<tr><th>Producer code</th><th>Consumer code</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
  
```java
    while(true){
    	empty.acquire();
        item = produceNewItem();
        full.release();
    }
```
    
</td>
<td>
    
```java
    while(true){
    	full.acquire();
        consumeItem(item);
        empty.release();
    }
```
    
</td>
</tr>
</table>


### Semaphores - Producer Consumer - multiple items
```java
Semaphore full = new Semaphore(0);
Semaphore empty = new Semaphore(CAPACITY);
Queue queue = new ArrayDeque();
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
```

<table>
<tr><th>Producer code</th><th>Consumer code</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
  
```java
while(true){
  Item item = produce();
  empty.acquire();
  lock.lock();
  queue.offer(item);
  lock.unlock();
  full.release();
}
```
    
</td>
<td>
    
```java
while(true){
  full.acquire();
  lock.lock();
  Item item = queue.poll();
  lock.unlock();
  empty.release();
}
```
    
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Semaphores : usage as a barrier
Say there is a method that is being executed by multiple threads concurrently. Now we want all the threads to have executed some part of the code, before even one thread can proceed to the next part. This can be done with the help of semaphores.
```java
void method1(){
  System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " : Executed first part of the code.");
  barrier();
  System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " : Executed second part of the code.");
}
```

If there are three threads, we want the output to be:
```
thread-0 : Executed first part of the code.
thread-1 : Executed first part of the code.
thread-2 : Executed first part of the code.
thread-0 : Executed second part of the code.
thread-1 : Executed second part of the code.
thread-2 : Executed second part of the code.
```
The barrier can then be implemented as :
```java
class Barrier{
 private int numberOfThreads;
 private int counter;
 private Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
 private Semaphore permits = new Semaphore(0);
 
 public Barrier(int numberOfThreads){
   this.numberOfThreads = numberOfThreads;
 }
 
 public void barrier(){
  boolean isLastThread = false;
  lock.lock();
  counter++;
  if(counter == numberOfThreads)
    isLastThread = true;
  lock.unlock();
  
  if(isLastThread){
    permits.release(numberOfThreads-1);
  }
  else {
   try{
     permits.acquire();
   }
   catch(InterruptedException e){}
  }
 }
}
```

### Condition Variables
* calling the acquire() method on a semaphore is equivalent to checking the condition "is number of permits > 0 ?"
* condition variable is a generic way of inter-thread communication
![ConditionVariable1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13499858/121806071-eaee8800-cc6b-11eb-9ff7-9a1cadb86162.png)
* condition variable is always associated with a lock
* The lock ensures atomic check and modification of the shared variables, involved in the condition.
* ```void await()``` : puts the thread to sleep, unlocks the associated lock, and waits for signal from another thread
* ```void signal()``` : wakes up a single thread that is waiting on the condition variable
* A thread that wakes up, needs to re-acquire the lock associated with the condition variable. If no thread is waiting on the condition variable, then no thread is going to be signalled. Unlike semaphore, where future threads' acquire() gets affected by previous release(), in condition variables, future threads do not get signalled.
* ```void signalAll()``` : broadcast a signall to all the threads waiting on this condition variable


### Objects as condition variables
* The Object class contains the following methods :
  * public final void wait() throws InterruptedException
  * public final void notify()
  * public final void notifyAll()
* Every java class inherits from the Object class.
* We can use any object as a condition variable and a lock (using the synchronized keyword).
* To call wait(), notify() or notifyAll(), we need to acquire the monitor of that object (use synchronized on that object)
* Object signalling vs Condition Variables

|Object signalling| Condition variable|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|synchronized(object) {|lock.lock()|
|}| lock.unlock()|
|object.wait()|condition.await()|
|object.notify()|condition.signal()|
|object.notifyAll()|condition.signalAll()|


## Lock-Free Algorithms, data-structures and techniques
**Problems with locks**
* Deadlocks : deadlocks are generally unrecoverable, can bring the application to a complete halt, and the more locks we have - the more the chances of a deadlock
* Slow Critical Section : one thread holds the lock for long, starving the other threads
* thread not releasing a lock (kill tolerance) : thread dies or forgets to release a lock, leaves all threads hanging forever

**Non-atomic operations - reason**
* a single java operations might turn into more than one hardware operations

**Lock Free Solution - Breakdown**
* utilize operations which are guaranteed to be one hardware operation
* A single hardware operations is atomic by definition, and is therefore threadsafe.
* AtomicX classes located in java.util.concurrent.atomic package (Internally uses the Unsafe Class which provides access to low level, native methods)
  * AtomicBoolean
  * AtomicInteger
  * AtomicIntegerArray
  * AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater<T>
  * AtomicLong
  * AtomicLongArray
  * AtomicLongFieldUpdater<R>
  * AtomicMarkableReference<V>
  * AtomicReference<V>
  * AtomicReferenceArray<E>
  * AtomicReferenceFieldUpdater<T,V>
  * AtomicStampedReference<V>
  * DoubleAccumulator
  * DoubleAdder
  * LongAccumulator
  * LongAdder
 
 
 **Compare And Set**
 * ```compareAndSet(V oldValue, V newValue)```
