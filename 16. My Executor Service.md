# Build your own executor service or thread pool

The two main components required to build a thread pool would be :
* **a queue** to hold the incoming runnable tasks
* **a list of custom threads**, where each thread will continuously poll the task queue, and if any task is available, will execute it in the same thread.   


The **execute** method would be used to submit tasks to the thread pool.

```java
public class MyThreadPool {

    /* A queue to hold the incoming Runnable tasks*/
    private ConcurrentLinkedQueue<Runnable> runnablesQueue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();
    private List<MyThreadPoolThread> threadsInPool = new LinkedList<>();
    private AtomicInteger poolSize = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public MyThreadPool(int poolSize) {
        this.poolSize = new AtomicInteger(poolSize);
        for(int i=0; i<poolSize; i++){
            MyThreadPoolThread t = new MyThreadPoolThread("my-thread-pool-thread-" + i);
            threadsInPool.add(t);
            t.start();
        }
    }

    /* public method which is used to submit Runnable tasks to the queue.*/
    public void execute(Runnable runnable){
        runnablesQueue.add(runnable);
    }

    private class MyThreadPoolThread extends Thread {

        private MyThreadPoolThread(String threadName){
            this.setName(threadName);
        }

        @Override
        public void run(){
            while(true){
                Runnable r;
                while((r = runnablesQueue.poll())  != null){
                    r.run(); // directly invoking run (as opposed to start() method) keeps the execution within the same thread
                }
                try {
                    sleep(1_000); // sleep for one second if there are no more runnables in queue
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    throw new RuntimeException(e);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```
