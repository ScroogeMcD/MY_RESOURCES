### JobManager vs TaskManager   
  * JobManager is like the master node
  * TaskManagers are like worker nodes
  * Each TaskManager can have one or more slots

### Stream processing terminologies
 * **Event time** : time at which an event actually <i>occurred</i> (valid_time)
 * **Processing time** : time at which events were <i>observed</i> in the system (transaction_time or knowledge_time)
 * **Windowing** : chopping up data into finite pieces along temporal boundaries
 * **Data processing - unbounded data - using batch engine** :
   * fixed window
   * sessions
 * **Data processing - unbounded data - streaming**
   * time agnostic : ex. filtering, inner-join
   * approximation : approximation algorithms like approximate top-N, streaming K-means
   * windowing by processing time : 
   * windowing by event time
 * **Watermarks** : A watermark is a notion of input completeness with respect to event times. A watermark with a value of time X makes the statement: "all input data with event times less than X have been observed". As such, watermarks act as a metric of progress when observing an unbounded data source with no known end.   
 * **Triggers** :A trigger is a mechanism for declaring when the output for a window should be materialized relative to some external signals. Triggers provide flexibility in choosing when outputs should be emitted.
