## Count Min Sketch
[Reference](https://florian.github.io/count-min-sketch/)   
This is a probabilistic data structure similar to Bloom Filters. We want to count the frequency of distinct elements in a stream.
One way to do this is maintaining a HashMap and increment the count for each occurrence of a key. However this will require a large amount of space, proportional
to the number of distinct keys in the stream.   
If we do not want the exact count, and can live with a close approximation, then a probabilistic strcuture like **Count-Min Sketch** can be used.

Let us start with an array of fixed size (say *m*), and have a HashFunction *h*. Everytime we get an element, we pass it via the hash function, find the corresponding location in the array, and then increment the count at that location by one. However the more the number of different elements getting hashed to the same location (**collision**), the more inaccurate our count would become.   
To solve this, we can try two things :
* **Option 1 : Increase the number of hash functions, for this single array of size *m*** : This will cause even more collisions across keys, so this will cause our count to be all the more inaccurate, than when we had just one hash function.
* **Option 2 : Increse the number of hash functions, and have one array for each hash function** : Instead of the earlier approach of having one array across all hash functions, we will now have one array for each hash function. So increasing hash functions will no longer collisions. And to reduce the inaccuracy due to collisions in one hash function, while querying the count of an element, we will hash it through all the functions, find the corresponding counts, and take the minimum of it. The matrix formed in this structure is called a sketch.
