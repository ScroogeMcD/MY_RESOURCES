#### Transport Layer Security (TLS)

### I. Key Exchange Problem   
* **Asymmetric cryptography** : We have a pair of key - one *public* and one *private*. The message recepient sends its public key to the message sender. The message sender
encrypts the message with this public key and sends the encrypted message to the recepient. The recepient decrypts the encrypted message with its private key.   

  Other than verifying that the public key belongs to the intended recepient (using Certificate Authorities), no secure key-exchange is required here.   
  
  **Problem** : One problem with Asymmetric crytography is that generating and using the public key is slow as this key needs to be very large.   

* **Symmetric cryptography** : Only one shared key is required here to both encrypt and decrypt messages. This scheme is faster because the key can be smaller.   

  **Problem** : How do you secretly share a secret key to enable encrypted communication ?   
  
### II. How does TLS work and solve the above problems ?
TLS uses a combination of the above schemes to solve the key exchange problem and facilitate the private connections needed for sending sensitive data.   


**TLS Handshake** is the start of a secure communication over the network. The following is a simplified view of the steps involved in TLS handshake.

* A client indicates to a server that it wants to connect and send some information about which "cipher suites" it supports and prefers. "Cipher suites" are sets
of encryption algorithms that the parties can use to generate keys and encrypt data.
* The server then sends its certificate and public key to the client, which the client can validate by referencing known lists of trusted CAs and by validating a certificate 
with the CA directly. (Optionally) The server might also ask the client to send back a certificate to verify itself.   
* Next the client generates a "session key" (symmetric key that the client and the server will use for symmetric encryption), and encrypts it using the server's 
public key shared in previous step.   
* The client sends the encrypted session key to the server.
* The server already has the private key required to decrypt the session key.   
* Now both parties have securely shared key that they can use to encrypt/decrypt messages.   
* As a final step, the client sends the server an indicator that it is ready to begin using only encrypted communication and an encrypted message, 
which the server verifies it can decrypt. The server repeats this process in the opposite direction.
* Now the TLS handshake is complete. All communication from this point onwards is encrypted.
* The session key is short lived. The communicating parties will need to repeat the handshake process if the session key expires or is discarded.
