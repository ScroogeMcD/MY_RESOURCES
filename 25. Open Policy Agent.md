## Open Policy Agent (OPA)

### Inputs to the authz decision making process
* **data** : For example, list of users alongwith the permissions they are granted. This data might change over time, and OPA caches its latest state in memory.
This data must be provided to OPA in JSON format.
* **query input** : It specifies the question that OPA must decide upon. The query input must be formatted as JSON.
* **policy** : Specifies the computation logic that - for the given `data` and `query input` - yields a policy decision or the query result. This computation logic 
is defined as a set of policy rules in OPA's custom policy language called `rego`.
