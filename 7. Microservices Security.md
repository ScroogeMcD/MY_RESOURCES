### 1. ASCII vs Base64 encoding   
<details>
  <summary>ASCII</summary>
 
  * has 128 characters (0 - 127), which represent the characters from the English alphabet alongwith numerals and some unprintable characters. 
  * Since there are a total of 128 characters, 7 bits are required to represent one ASCII code (2^7 = 128). 
  * However, most computers store data in bytes (8 bits). So many systems simply wipe off the most significant bit (1st bit from left), and use only the remaining 7 bits for representation. This behaviour is different across computers. 
  * Some of the characters in ASCII - like carriage_return, line_feed etc - are not uniformly interpreted across computers, leading to confusions.

<details>
 <summary>base64</summary>
 
 * Uses only a subset of ASCII - only 64 characters. So each character can now be represented by 6 bits (2^6 = 64).
   *  0 - 25 : A-Z
   * 26 - 51 : a-z
   * 52 - 61 : 0-9
   * 62 - 63 : + and /
 * Downside of base64 is that 3 bytes (24 bits) in ASCII now need 4 bytes in base64.
 * Every 6 bits of ASCII representation are converted to 1 character of base64.
 * Each group of 3 bytes(24 bits) is converted into 4 characters of base64.
 * If the size of ASCII bytes is not a multiple of 3, then extra padding in the form of '=' is added.
 * Here is a visual representation of base64 encoding [https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2017/10/23/base64-encoding-a-visual-explanation/]
