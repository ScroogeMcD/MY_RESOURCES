### 1. ASCII vs Base64 encoding   
<details>
  <summary>ASCII</summary>
 
  * has 128 characters (0 - 127), which represent the characters from the English alphabet alongwith numerals and some unprintable characters. 
  * Since there are a total of 128 characters, 7 bits are required to represent one ASCII code (2^7 = 128). 
  * However, most computers store data in bytes (8 bits). So many systems simply wipe off the most significant bit (1st bit from left), and use only the remaining 7 bits for representation. This behaviour is different across computers. 
  * Some of the characters in ASCII - like carriage_return, line_feed etc - are not uniformly interpreted across computers, leading to confusions.

<details>
 <summary>base64</summary>
 
 * Uses only a subset of ASCII - only 64 characters. So each character can now be represented by 6 bits (2^6 = 64).
   *  0 - 25 : A-Z
   * 26 - 51 : a-z
   * 52 - 61 : 0-9
   * 62 - 63 : + and /
 * Downside of base64 is that 3 bytes (24 bits) in ASCII now need 4 bytes in base64.
 * Every 6 bits of ASCII representation are converted to 1 character of base64.
 * Each group of 3 bytes(24 bits) is converted into 4 characters of base64.
 * If the size of ASCII bytes is not a multiple of 3, then extra padding in the form of '=' is added.
 * Here is a visual representation of base64 encoding [https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2017/10/23/base64-encoding-a-visual-explanation/]

### 2. Subject, Principal and IdentityProvider
<details>
  <summary> Subject </summary>
  
  * Subject is the entity requesting access. It can be a user, service, or piece of code.
  * A digital identity for a user is made up of claims about that user. For ex :
    * username  : User1
    * firstName : David
    * DOB       : Jan 1, 1990
</details>
<details>
  <summary> Principal </summary>
  
  * Principals are subsets of the above mentioned attributes, in the identity of User1. These can identify user 'User1'
  * 'User1' can have multiple principals : one for an app that he uses, another for some other purpose.Each will be appropriate number of attributes about him. Ideally the basre minimum required.
  * These principals need to be stored somewhere for easy access.
</details>
<details>
  <summary> Identity Provider </summary>
  
  * A service that manages creation and maintenance of identity information for principals.
  * If tokens are involved, it may be called a **Security Token Service** or an **Authorization Server**.
  * Identity Provider can also authenticate a principal. This is known as **Authentication as a Service**.
  
  
  Control flow :
  * user makes a request to an API gateway, through a client (say a mobile app).
  * API gateway returns a 401 unauthorized error.
  * Client (acting as a relaying party) redirects to IdentityService provider.
  * IdentityProvider challenges user to be authenticated.
  * User - through client - enters username, password.
  * Once authenticated, the IdentityProvider returns a **Token** to the client.
  * The client can now include this Token in all subsequent requests to the API Gateway, and also hold on to the token, effectively providing Single-Sign-On.
  * The API Gateway can all the **introspection endpoint** of the **IdentityProvider** to validate the token, and also it can call a **UserInfo** endpoint to retrieve the claims about the user.
  * This however becomes a problem, with tens of thousands of users making multiple API requests per minute.
  * To reduce the calls to the IdentityProvider, the IdentityProvider can add claims to the tokens itself. These are called **By-Value** tokens.
  * Claims define what the subject is, and is not.
  * Claims can contain different attributes of the subject, as well as how was the subject authenticated and by who.
  * The token will be signed by the IdentityProvider's private key. The bearer of the token can then verify the token using the IdentityProvider's Public key to confirm that the token was not tampered with.
  * Examples of by-value tokens :
    * 1990's : Kerberos (protocol specific)
    * 2002   : SAML (protocol specific)  - XML based
    * 2015   : JWT (protocol agnostic)   - JSON based
  * To reduce the calls to the IdentityProvider, the IdentityProvider can add claims to the tokens itself. 
  * To reduce the calls to the IdentityProvider, the IdentityProvider can add claims to the tokens itself.
