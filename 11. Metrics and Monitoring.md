## Types of metrics [from Prometheus]
* **Counter** : A cumulative metrics that represents a single *monotonically increasing counter*, whose value can only increase or be reset to zero on restart. 
Do not use a counter to expose a value that can decrease.
* **Gauge** : A metric that represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily go up and down.
* **Histogram** : Samples observations, and counts them in configurable buckets. It also provides a sum of all configurable values.
