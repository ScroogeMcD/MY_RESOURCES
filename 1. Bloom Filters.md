## Bloom Filters

### Bloom Filter key points
* probabilistic data structure used to determine the membership of an element in a set of elements
* a compact way of representing a set of items
* checking for existence in a set becomes very cheap
* some probability of **false positives** : an element not in the set may still be returned as being present in the set
* never **false negatives** : if it returns that an element is not present in the set, it is 100% true

### How does a Bloom Filter work ?   
An empty bloom filter is a bit array of **m** bits, all of which are initially set to zero. A bloom filter also includes a set of k hash functions, with which we hash incoming values. These hash functions must all have a range of 0 to (m-1). To add an element to the bloom filter, **k** independent hash functions are used to generate k indices into the bit array, and the corresponding bits are set to 1. 

A query (to check whether an element is present in the bit-array or not) is positive iff all k referenced bits are 1.   
A negative query clearly indicates that the element is not present in the Bloom filter. A positive query however, may be due to a false positive , the case in which the queried element was not added to the bloom filter, but all k queried bits are 1 (due to other additions).
