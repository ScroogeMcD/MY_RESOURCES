## Bloom Filters

### Bloom Filter key points
* probabilistic data structure used to determine the membership of an element in a set of elements
* a compact way of representing a set of items
* checking for existence in a set becomes very cheap
* some probability of **false positives** : an element not in the set may still be returned as being present in the set
* never **false negatives** : if it returns that an element is not present in the set, it is 100% true

### How does a Bloom Filter work ?   
An empty bloom filter is a bit array of **m** bits, all of which are initially set to zero. A bloom filter also includes a set of k hash functions, with which we hash incoming values. These hash functions must all have a range of 0 to (m-1). To add an element to the bloom filter, **k** independent hash functions are used to generate k indices into the bit array, and the corresponding bits are set to 1. 

A query (to check whether an element is present in the bit-array or not) is positive iff all k referenced bits are 1.   
A negative query clearly indicates that the element is not present in the Bloom filter. A positive query however, may be due to a false positive , the case in which the queried element was not added to the bloom filter, but all k queried bits are 1 (due to other additions).

### Probability calculations

m - size of the bit vector
k - number of hash functions

Probability that any specific bit is set after inserting first key, with only one hash function = 1/m   

Probability that any specific bit is **not** set after inserting first key, with only one hash function = (1 - 1/m)   

Probability that any specific bit is not set after inserting first key, with k hash functions = (1 - 1/m)<sup>k</sup>   

Probability that any specific bit is bot set after inserting n keys, with k hash functions each = (1 - 1/m)<sup>nk</sup>   
Or in other words, the probability that a bit is still 0 after inserting n keys in a table of size m is (1 - 1/m)<sup>nk</sup>   


Therefore, probability of a false positive i.e. key is not present but corresponding bits are set to zero is : (1 - (1 - 1/m)<sup>nk</sup>)<sup>k</sup>
