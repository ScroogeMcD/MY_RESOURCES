## Bloom Filters

### Bloom Filter key points
* probabilistic data structure used to determine the membership of an element in a set of elements
* a compact way of representing a set of items
* checking for existence in a set becomes very cheap
* some probability of **false positives** : an element not in the set may still be returned as being present in the set
* never **false negatives** : if it returns that an element is not present in the set, it is 100% true

### How does a Bloom Filter work ?   
A bloom filter is essentially a very large bitmap. Say we have a key KEY1. We use a small set of hash-functions (1 to k) to hash the key KEY1.
