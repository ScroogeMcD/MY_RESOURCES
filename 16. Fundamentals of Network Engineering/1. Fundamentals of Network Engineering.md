# Fundamentals of network engineering
## OSI model
Open Systems Interconnection model
- **Layer 7 : Application** - HTTP/FTP/gRPC
- **Layer 6 : Presentation** - Encoding, Serialization
- **Layer 5 : Session** - Connection establishment, TLS
- **Layer 4 : Transport** - UDP/TCP
- **Layer 3 : Network** - IP
- **Layer 2 : Data Link** - Frames, Mac address Ethernet
- **Layer 1 : Physical** - Electric signals, fiber or radio waves

## Host to Host communication
- Each host network card has a unique Media Access Control (**MAC**) address
- Say a network has 4 hosts (A,B,C and D) all connected to each other. A sends a message to B specifiying the MAC address. Everyone in the network will "get" the message, but only B will accept it.
- Since, there are billions of devices, each device cannot store the MAC address of all other devices out there, else everytime a huge scan will be required to send frames to correct recipient. This is why routing is required.
- The IP address is built in two parts :
  - One part is to identify the network, the other is the host.
  - We use the network portion to eliminate many networks   
  - The host part is used to find the host
  - Still needs MAC addresses

## The IP Building Blocks

## ICMP, PING, TraceRoute

## IP Packet

## ARP

## Capturing IP, ARP and ICMP packets with TCPDUMP

## Routing Example
