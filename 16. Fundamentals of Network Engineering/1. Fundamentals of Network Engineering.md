# Fundamentals of network engineering
## OSI model
Open Systems Interconnection model
- **Layer 7 : Application** - HTTP/FTP/gRPC
- **Layer 6 : Presentation** - Encoding, Serialization
- **Layer 5 : Session** - Connection establishment, TLS
- **Layer 4 : Transport** - UDP/TCP
- **Layer 3 : Network** - IP
- **Layer 2 : Data Link** - Frames, Mac address Ethernet
- **Layer 1 : Physical** - Electric signals, fiber or radio waves

## Host to Host communication
- Each host network card has a unique Media Access Control (**MAC**) address
- Say a network has 4 hosts (A,B,C and D) all connected to each other. A sends a message to B specifiying the MAC address. Everyone in the network will "get" the message, but only B will accept it.
- Since, there are billions of devices, each device cannot store the MAC address of all other devices out there, else everytime a huge scan will be required to send frames to correct recipient. This is why routing is required.
- The IP address is built in two parts :
  - One part is to identify the network, the other is the host.
  - We use the network portion to eliminate many networks   
  - The host part is used to find the host
  - Still needs MAC addresses

## The IP Building Blocks
- The router in my home gets assigned a public IP address, by my Internet Service Provider (ISP).
- When I connect my laptop, or cell phone to my home router, a piece of software server (DHCP) assigns different private IP addresses to each of my devices. However their public IP address still remains same as the one of the router.
-  Default Gateway
  - Most networks consist of hosts and a Default Gateway
  - The gateway has an IP address and each host should know its gateway

## Network classes and CIDR
An IP address consists of two parts: **Network Identifier** and **Host Identifier**

In order to find out how many bits (of this 32 bit IPV4 address) constitute the network part, the IPV4 addresses have been split into different classes.
The first four bits of an IP address determine its class.

|Network class|four prefix bits|address range|Network Mask|Total possible networks|Total possible hosts in a network|
|-------------|----------------|-------------|------------|----------|-------------|
|A|0___|`0.0.0.0` to `127.255.255.255`|`255.0.0.0`|2<sup>7</sup> (since 1st bit is already used for class identification)|2<sup>24</sup>|
|B|10__|`128.0.0.0` to `191.255.255.255`|`255.255.0.0`|2<sup>14</sup> (6 bits of first octet and 8 of second octet)|2<sup>16</sup>|
|C|110_|`192.0.0.0` to `223.255.255.255`|`255.255.255.0`|2<sup>21</sup> (5 bits of first octet, 8 of second and 8 of third)|2<sup>8</sup> |
|D|1110|`224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`||||
|E|1111|`240.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255`||||

So just by looking at an IP address, we can tell which class does it belong to, what is its `network mask`, and hence the corresponding `network id` and `host id`.

### Subnetting
The process of splitting a network into smaller network sections is called **subnetting**. By default, each network consists of only one subnet which consists of all the host addresses defined within.</br>

**CIDR** : **C**lassless **I**nter **D**omain **R**outing </br>
For ex. consider : `128.54.177.97/24` .</br>
Here `/24` is the subnext mask. It means a 32 bit binary with the first 24 bits as ones.   
`/24` => `1111 1111`.`1111 1111`.`1111 1111`.`0000 0000`.  
A logical `AND` of IP address and the subnet mask gives the network+subnet identifier.

It is said that a data packet will be **routed** if in order to be delivered, the packet must leave the network segment it currently is in.  
It is said that a data packet will be **switched** if it does not have to leave the network segment to be delivered. 



## ICMP, PING, TraceRoute
**ICMP** : **I**nternet **C**ontrol **M**essage **P**rotocol.  
- Designed for informational messages, lives in Layer3 (only IP, not ports)
  - Host unreachable, port unreachable, fragmentation needed
  - Packet expired (infinite loop in routers)
- Uses IP directly
- `PING` and `traceroute` use it
- Doesn't require listeners or ports to be opened
- While with `PING` we only find whether the dest IP is reachable, it does not show the route that the packet took. We can use `traceroute` to show this packet.
- `ping google.com`
- `traceroute google.com`
