# Fundamentals of network engineering
## OSI model
Open Systems Interconnection model
- **Layer 7 : Application** - HTTP/FTP/gRPC
- **Layer 6 : Presentation** - Encoding, Serialization
- **Layer 5 : Session** - Connection establishment, TLS
- **Layer 4 : Transport** - UDP/TCP
- **Layer 3 : Network** - IP
- **Layer 2 : Data Link** - Frames, Mac address Ethernet
- **Layer 1 : Physical** - Electric signals, fiber or radio waves

## Host to Host communication
- Each host network card has a unique Media Access Control (**MAC**) address
- Say a network has 4 hosts (A,B,C and D) all connected to each other. A sends a message to B specifiying the MAC address. Everyone in the network will "get" the message, but only B will accept it.
- Since, there are billions of devices, each device cannot store the MAC address of all other devices out there, else everytime a huge scan will be required to send frames to correct recipient. This is why routing is required.
- The IP address is built in two parts :
  - One part is to identify the network, the other is the host.
  - We use the network portion to eliminate many networks   
  - The host part is used to find the host
  - Still needs MAC addresses

## The IP Building Blocks
- The router in my home gets assigned a public IP address, by my Internet Service Provider (ISP).
- When I connect my laptop, or cell phone to my home router, a piece of software server (DHCP) assigns different private IP addresses to each of my devices. However their public IP address still remains same as the one of the router.
-  Default Gateway
  - Most networks consist of hosts and a Default Gateway
  - The gateway has an IP address and each host should know its gateway

## Network classes and CIDR
An IP address consists of two parts: **Network Identifier** and **Host Identifier**

In order to find out how many bits (of this 32 bit IPV4 address) constitute the network part, the IPV4 addresses have been split into different classes.
The first four bits of an IP address determine its class.

|Network class|four prefix bits|address range|Network Mask|Total possible networks|Total possible hosts in a network|
|-------------|----------------|-------------|------------|----------|-------------|
|A|0___|`0.0.0.0` to `127.255.255.255`|`255.0.0.0`|2<sup>7</sup> (since 1st bit is already used for class identification)|2<sup>24</sup>|
|B|10__|`128.0.0.0` to `191.255.255.255`|`255.255.0.0`|2<sup>14</sup> (6 bits of first octet and 8 of second octet)|2<sup>16</sup>|
|C|110_|`192.0.0.0` to `223.255.255.255`|`255.255.255.0`|2<sup>21</sup> (5 bits of first octet, 8 of second and 8 of third)|2<sup>8</sup> |
|D|1110|`224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`||||
|E|1111|`240.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255`||||

So just by looking at an IP address, we can tell which class does it belong to, what is its `network mask`, and hence the corresponding `network id` and `host id`.

### Subnetting
The process of splitting a network into smaller network sections is called **subnetting**. By default, each network consists of only one subnet which consists of all the host addresses defined within.</br>

**CIDR** : **C**lassless **I**nter **D**omain **R**outing </br>
For ex. consider : `128.54.177.97/24` .</br>
Here `/24` is the subnext mask. It means a 32 bit binary with the first 24 bits as ones.   
`/24` => `1111 1111`.`1111 1111`.`1111 1111`.`0000 0000`.  
A logical `AND` of IP address and the subnet mask gives the network+subnet identifier.

It is said that a data packet will be **routed** if in order to be delivered, the packet must leave the network segment it currently is in.  
It is said that a data packet will be **switched** if it does not have to leave the network segment to be delivered. 

### How is an IP address assigned to an NIC ?
One way is where the Network Interface Card (NIC) gets its IP address using the DHCP protocol. The involves the NIC sending out a DHCP request and a DHCP server responding to that request. The DHCP server provides the requesting NIC with : 
- an IP address
- Network Mask
- Gateway address
- address of a DNS server



## ICMP, PING, TraceRoute
**ICMP** : **I**nternet **C**ontrol **M**essage **P**rotocol.  
- Designed for informational messages, lives in Layer3 (only IP, not ports)
  - Host unreachable, port unreachable, fragmentation needed
  - Packet expired (infinite loop in routers)
- Uses IP directly
- `PING` and `traceroute` use it
- Doesn't require listeners or ports to be opened
- While with `PING` we only find whether the dest IP is reachable, it does not show the route that the packet took. We can use `traceroute` to show this packet.
- `ping google.com`
- `traceroute google.com`

## ARP - Address Resolution Protocol
ARP is used to get the MAC address for a given IP within the same network.   
![Network_ARP_1 drawio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13499858/221409977-ecce093c-f1a6-45ec-a0ce-a1180ef4639d.png)

The Layer2 device (switch) has multiple ports. Whenever a host connects to the switch on any of the ports, the switch keeps a map of MAC address of the host to the corresponding port. So the switch knows which host is connected to which port. For now, assume the switch does not have its own MAC address. Since each hosts are connected directly to the switch, they can send their packets to it without knowing its MAC address.

Now, say **Host 1** (IP: `10.0.0.11`) wants to send a packet to IP: `10.0.0.13` (which is **Host 3**)
- **Host1** uses its own subnet mask `255.255.255.0` to determine whether the desination IP is in sae subnet or not. It finds that both the hosts are in the same subnet, and hence only switching is needed, not routing.
- **Host1** checks its own ARP cache to find whether it has a mapping of the destination IP to the corresponding MAC address.
- If it does not have it, it broadcasts an ARP Request message, asking each host in the network the question **Who has the MAC address for IP:10.0.0.13?**. It sends this message on a special MAC address `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`, which means this packet is to be broadcasted by the switch, by pushing it to all the hosts connected to its ports.   
```
ARP REQUEST
Src IP  : 10.0.0.11
Dest IP : 10.0.0.13
Src MAC : AB:CD:AB:CD:EF:11
Dest MAC: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
```
- The Switch broadcasts this message to all its ports.
- **Host 2** receives this message, sees that it is not for it, and drops it.
- **Host 3** receives this message, sees that it is for it, stores the IP and MAC address of **Host 1** in its own ARP cache, and replies with an ARP reply, sending its own MAC address.</br>
```
ARP REPLY
Src IP  : 10.0.0.13
Dest IP : 10.0.0.11
Src MAC : AB:CD:AB:CD:EF:13
Dest MAC: AB:CD:AB:CD:EF:11
```
- Switch sends the response to Host1, using the Dest MAC address in the REPLY message
- **Host 1** receives this message, stores the IP and MAC of **Host 3** in its own **ARP cache**.
- **Host 1** now sends a packet to **Host 3** IP, with the exact **Host 3** MAC address, which is used by switch to directly send it to **Host 3**. Broadcasting is no longer needed.


## NAT - Network Address Translation
**ToDo : refine this later**
The IP packet has four fields (amongst others). These are : 
```
SrcIP :
SrcPort : 
DestIP:
DestPort:
```
The NAT router, replaces the SrcIP with its own IP, and the `SrcPort` with a random generated port number. When the response is received back from this DestIP and DestPort for the Router's IP and previously generated random port, it lookup within its own port, to replace its own IP and port with the original host's IP and port.
