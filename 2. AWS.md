### AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

The above diagram has one availability zone (AZ) in the VPC. This AZ has two subnets - one public and one private. The public one can be accessed from outside the VPC, whereas the private one can be accessed only from within the VPC. The public subnet is connected to the **internet gateway** using **route tables**. In practice however, we would have more than one AZs in the VPC, and since we would not want our users to decide on which public subnet (from the two or more AZs to connect to), hence we will attach a **LoadBalancer**, which will be invoked by the clients. This load balancer will then internally route the traffic to different AZs.
