### Networking in AWS : Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

The above diagram has one availability zone (AZ) in the VPC. This AZ has two subnets - one public and one private. The public one can be accessed from outside the VPC, whereas the private one can be accessed only from within the VPC. The public subnet is connected to the **internet gateway** using **route tables**. In practice however, we would have more than one AZs in the VPC, and since we would not want our users to decide on which public subnet (from the two or more AZs to connect to), hence we will attach a **LoadBalancer**, which will be invoked by the clients. This load balancer will then internally route the traffic to different AZs.

### Storage in AWS   
#### Block Storage vs Object Storage   
**Block Storage** :    
 * Files are split into evenly sized blocks of data
 * Each block has its own address, but no additional information (metadata)to provide more context on what that block of data is
 * provides the ability to incrementally edit one part of the file   
**Object Storage** :     
 * Doesn't split files into raw blocks of data. Instead entire clump of data is stored together.
 * Every object contains three things :    
   * the data itself
   * expandable amount of metadata
   * a globally unique identifier
 * Doesn't provide us with the ability to incrementally edit one part of the file. Objects have to be manipulated as a whole unit, requiring the entire object to be accessed, updated and then re-written in entirety.
 * Object based storage architectures can be scaled out and managed simply by adding additional nodes.
