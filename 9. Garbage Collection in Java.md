## Garbage Collection in Java

### 1. Memory Allocation types

i. **Allocator types** and their corresponding GC tehniques :
 * *Sequential or Bump Allocators* - corresponding garbage collection techniques are :
   * Mark - Compact
   * Copying GC
   * Generational GC
 * *Free List Allocators* - corresponding garbage collection techniques are :
   * Mark and Sweep
   * Reference Count GC
   * Manual Memory Management

ii. **Garbage Collection types**
 * *tracing collectors* : they identify the live objects, and all the remaining objects are considered garbage
   * Mark-Sweep
   * Mark-compact
   * Copying GC
 * *direct collectors*
   * Reference Counting

<details>
  <summary> 2.i. Mark - Sweep Collector </summary>
  
   | Feature | Description |
   |---------|-------------|
   | *type* | Tracing : search for live objects - starting from GC roots, everything else is garbage|
   | *phases* |Mark(trace), Sweep(Reclaim); Sweep scans the whole heap unless generational, and returns the memory block to free list|
   | *moving* |No (good for languages exposing pointer semantics like C,C++); objects stay at the same location after GC|
   | *allocator* |free-list (slower); linked list of free blocks of memory, slower allocation|
   | *issues* |Fragmentatio of heap|
</details>  

<details>
  <summary> 2.ii. Mark - Compact Collector </summary>
  
   | Feature | Description |
   |---------|-------------|
   | *type* | Tracing : search for live objects - starting from GC roots, everything else is garbage|
   | *phases* | Mark(trace), Compact(move live objects)|
   | *moving* | yes (can't be used by languages exposing pointer semantics)|
   | *allocator* | sequential("bump allocator", fast)|
   | *issues* | *upto 3 times heap traversal* |

    Compaction Algorithms :
    * Two-finger
    * The lisp 2
      * Compute locations : compute the new locations where the objects will eventually be relocated
      * Update references : for each alive object, fix their child references to point to the new locations
      * Relocate : move alive objects to the new locations recorded in the forwarding addresses
    * Threaded
    * One pass
</details> 

<details>
  <summary>2.iii. Copying collector</summary>
  
    - Splits heap into two areas : **TO** and **FROM**
    - all new memory is allocated in FROM area, using bump allocator
    - once the FROM area gets filled up, GC is trigerred
      - **copy** : evacuate live objects, i.e. move them from FROM to TO area
      - **forward** : add or keep 'forwarding' address in the old objects in FROM space, pointing to corresponding new objets in TO space
      - **fix pointers** : update child pointers
      - **swap** : flip FROM and TO areas in terms of roles. Old FROM becomes new TO and vice versa. New allocation happens in new FROM area.


   | Feature | Description |
   |---------|-------------|
   | *type* | Tracing : search for live objects - starting from GC roots, everything else is garbage. Copying over happens in this tracing phase itself.|
   | *phases* | evacuate (copy), update pointers : copy live objects to new space, abandon garbage in old space|
   | *moving* | yes (can't be used by languages exposing pointer semantics)|
   | *allocator* | sequential("bump allocator", fast)|
   | *issues* | reserves almost half of the heap for GC purposes |
</details>

<details>
  <summary> 2.iv. Reference Counting Collector </summary>
  
  - Objects can be reclaimed right when their reference count goes down to zero.
  - cyclic references cause the reference-count of some objects to never go down to zero, causing memory-leaks.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| *type* | Direct : Identifies garbage directly. Reclaims as long as no references.|
| *phases* | Inc/DecRef(dest/src), free(recursively)|
| *moving* | no (good for languages exposing pointer semantics)|
| *allocator* | Free list (slower)|
| *issues* | can't handle cycles, mutator overhead |

### 3. Advanced topics
#### 3.1 Generational Collector
- Splits Heap into different generations, so that heap scan for garbage collection is done only in one region at a time, and not all simultaneously.
- **Weak generational hypothesis** : Most objects die young. These are temporary local variables, data for which is allocated on heap, but they don't live long enough.
- **Young Generation** : Used for allocation, and is collected more frequently. (Minor GC)
- **Old Generation** : Collected less frequently. The only way to get here is by promotion from Young Generation. (Major GC)

In the following figure, during minor GC, we will mark alive objects reachable only from Root2. Now if the B->D object edge breaks, then D and F will be unreachable from Root2, and hence eligible for collection. However F is still reachable from Root1 via object Z which is in Old Generation. Thus garbage collecting F would be incorrect. This is an example of *intergenerational pointer* - a reference from old generation to young generation.    
To handle this, generational collectors use a **write barrier** - a trap called for every "STORE POINTER" operation. Whenever we store a pointer from Old to Young Gen, the Write Barrier trap is invoked, which puts the old gen object (Z) into the current (virtual) GC roots sets.

![GC-WriteBarrier](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13499858/120108826-705e3c80-c184-11eb-97be-b9deb72c7853.png)

**Implementation for virtual GC roots** :
The old gen memory is divided into fixed size chunks (of, say, 4 KB), and a **CARD TABLE** is maintained which is a bit map, representing one bit for each of these memory chunks. Whenever an inter-generational pointer is created, the corresponding bit in the card table for this block is marked dirty. In the next GC cycle, all the objects in these dirty memory blocks are considered as virtual roots.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| *type* | Tracing : Identifies live objects. However does not need to scan all generations or entire heap at once.|
| *phases* | Minor(Young collect), Major (Tenured Collect) : Including per-generation algorithms: Mark,Copy etc. Java has 5 gens |
| *moving* | yes (can't be used for languages exposing pointer semantics)|
| *allocator* | per-generation (free-list or bump-allocator)|
| *issues* | write-barrier overhead (all store-pointer operations have to be tracked) |

#### 3.2 Comparison of Tracing collectors
|Collector Type| Mutator Overhead| Fast Reclaim| Space Efficient|
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
|**Mark-Sweep**|Bad|Good|Good|
|**Mark-Compact**|Good|Bad|Good|
|**Copying GC**|Good|Good|Bad|

Thus we see that each of the tracing collectors perform good in only two of above mentioned three criteria.

#### 3.3 Mark-Region GC : Immix Collector
Mark-Region is a combination of Mark-Sweep(tracing) and Copying GC(defragmentation).
**Immix Collector** performs well in all the three criteria of Mutator Overhead, Fast Reclaim, and Space Efficiency. It splits the memory into multiple blocks and then each block is split into multiple lines. Usually the size of the block is 32KB and the size of each line if 128 bytes.

**Allocation in Immix** : Before requesting for a full new block, Immix tries to reuse and existing recyclable block. It uses fast bump-allocation in the free lines of the recyclable blocks. It can also allocate objects across lines contiguously. Allocation can leave blocks in fragmented state. For example, in the 4th line of block 3, we see that after allocating an object, some space was still left in the line. It is possible that this remaining free space might not be sufficient for new allocations and hence would be left as a hole. However this fragmentation will be taken care of later.

**Collection in Immix** : 
  * *Mark Phase* : Marking would be done during tracing for live objects itself.We start from GC roots, and mark an object alive. Now if an object is alive, its   corresponding **line is marked alive**. Also since a line is marked alive, its corresponding **Block is also marked alive**. 
  * *Sweep Phase* : The sweep phase is much more opitmized in immix, than in the basic mark-sweep. In the basic mark sweep, we need to traverse all the objects in the heap. In immix we sweep region wise. We start with a block. If a block is marked alive, we need to go deeper into the block to check its lines. If a line is not marked alive (meaning none of the ojects in the line are alive), we can reclaim the entire line at once, without needing to traverse each of the objects within the line individually. The Sweep Phase makes the following block recyclable, i.e. it can be used for further allocation. Notice that in the sweep phase, we leave the lines 2 and 5 untouched, even though they have some memory which cannot be reached i.e. is not alive. This leaves the block with fragmentation. Copying over this block to a new free block using bump allocation, removes the fragmentation.

Mark-Region Summary
| Feature | Description | Comments|
|---------|-------------|---------|
| *Mark-Region* | Mark-Sweep + Copying + Partitioning| Combines several basic algorithms operating on heap regions|
| *Partitioning* |Blocks and Lines| Objects are grouped in Lines, which are grouped in Blocks |
| *Allocation* |Fast Bump-Allocator| Allocate in recyclable or Free blocks. Evacuate with the same Bump-Allocation|
| *Reclaim* |Per Block and Line| Sweep by Line and Block Granularity |


#### 3.4 Parallel, Incremental, Concurrent GC
So far we have seen that when GC takes place, the Mutator threads (i.e. threads of application requesting the memory) are completely blocked. This is called **Stop-the-world** pause.
* **Serial collection** : Just one GC threads during collection
* **Parallel** : Multiple GC threads, each operating on a specific area of heap.
* **Incremental** : Collector can be interrupted by Mutator, even when collection is not complete. Now it might so happen that an Objct A was not marked alive (hence garbage) by the collector, and then the Mutator interrupted. The Mutator then set an alive reference to this object A. When the GC resumes, it would still consider A as garbge and reclaim it, while the Mutator would not want A to be reclaimed. Such synchronization issues can be resolved by **GC Read-Write barriers**.
* **Concurrent** : Collector can run concurrently with Mutator before completion. Mutator does not need to be blocked for the entire duration of collection. Again this too needs synchronization GC barriers.  These collectors can run concurrently with the mutator only for some of the phases. At some point, we still need Stop-the-world pause.
