## Garbage Collection in Java

### 1. Memory Allocation types

i. **Allocator types** and their corresponding GC tehniques :
 * *Sequential or Bump Allocators* - corresponding garbage collection techniques are :
   * Mark - Compact
   * Copying GC
   * Generational GC
 * *Free List Allocators* - corresponding garbage collection techniques are :
   * Mark and Sweep
   * Reference Count GC
   * Manual Memory Management

ii. **Garbage Collection types**
 * *tracing collectors* : they identify the live objects, and all the remaining objects are considered garbage
   * Mark-Sweep
   * Mark-compact
   * Copying GC
 * *direct collectors*
   * Reference Counting

### 2. Garbage Collectors :

<details>
  <summary> 2.i. Mark - Sweep Collector </summary>
  
   | Feature | Description |
   |---------|-------------|
   | *type* | Tracing : search for live objects - starting from GC roots, everything else is garbage|
   | *phases* |Mark(trace), Sweep(Reclaim); Sweep scans the whole heap unless generational, and returns the memory block to free list|
   | *moving* |No (good for languages exposing pointer semantics like C,C++); objects stay at the same location after GC|
   | *allocator* |free-list (slower); linked list of free blocks of memory, slower allocation|
   | *issues* |Fragmentatio of heap|
</details>  

<details>
  <summary> 2.ii. Mark - Compact Collector </summary>
  
   | Feature | Description |
   |---------|-------------|
   | *type* | Tracing : search for live objects - starting from GC roots, everything else is garbage|
   | *phases* | Mark(trace), Compact(move live objects)|
   | *moving* | yes (can't be used by languages exposing pointer semantics)|
   | *allocator* | sequential("bump allocator", fast)|
   | *issues* | *upto 3 times heap traversal* |

    Compaction Algorithms :
    * Two-finger
    * The lisp 2
      * Compute locations : compute the new locations where the objects will eventually be relocated
      * Update references : for each alive object, fix their child references to point to the new locations
      * Relocate : move alive objects to the new locations recorded in the forwarding addresses
    * Threaded
    * One pass
</details> 

<details>
  <summary>2.iii. Copying collector</summary>
  
    - Splits heap into two areas : **TO** and **FROM**
    - all new memory is allocated in FROM area, using bump allocator
    - once the FROM area gets filled up, GC is trigerred
      - **copy** : evacuate live objects, i.e. move them from FROM to TO area
      - **forward** : add or keep 'forwarding' address in the old objects in FROM space, pointing to corresponding new objets in TO space
      - **fix pointers** : update child pointers
      - **swap** : flip FROM and TO areas in terms of roles. Old FROM becomes new TO and vice versa. New allocation happens in new FROM area.


   | Feature | Description |
   |---------|-------------|
   | *type* | Tracing : search for live objects - starting from GC roots, everything else is garbage. Copying over happens in this tracing phase itself.|
   | *phases* | evacuate (copy), update pointers : copy live objects to new space, abandon garbage in old space|
   | *moving* | yes (can't be used by languages exposing pointer semantics)|
   | *allocator* | sequential("bump allocator", fast)|
   | *issues* | reserves almost half of the heap for GC purposes |
</details>

<details>
  <summary> 2.iv. Reference Counting Collector </summary>
  
  - Objects can be reclaimed right when their reference count goes down to zero.
  - cyclic references cause the reference-count of some objects to never go down to zero, causing memory-leaks.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| *type* | Direct : Identifies garbage directly. Reclaims as long as no references.|
| *phases* | Inc/DecRef(dest/src), free(recursively)|
| *moving* | no (good for languages exposing pointer semantics)|
| *allocator* | Free list (slower)|
| *issues* | can't handle cycles, mutator overhead |

### 3. Advanced topics
#### 3.1 Generational Collector
- Splits Heap into different generations, so that heap scan for garbage collection is done only in one region at a time, and not all simultaneously.
- **Weak generational hypothesis** : Most objects die young. These are temporary local variables, data for which is allocated on heap, but they don't live long enough.
- **Young Generation** : Used for allocation, and is collected more frequently. (Minor GC)
- **Old Generation** : Collected less frequently. The only way to get here is by promotion from Young Generation. (Major GC)

In the following figure, during minor GC, we will mark alive objects reachable only from Root2. Now if the B->D object edge breaks, then D and F will be unreachable from Root2, and hence eligible for collection. However F is still reachable from Root1 via object Z which is in Old Generation. Thus garbage collecting F would be incorrect. This is an example of *intergenerational pointer* - a reference from old generation to young generation.    
To handle this, generational collectors use a **write barrier** - a trap called for every "STORE POINTER" operation. Whenever we store a pointer from Old to Young Gen, the Write Barrier trap is invoked, which puts the old gen object (Z) into the current (virtual) GC roots sets.

**Implementation for virtual GC roots** :
The old gen memory is divided into fixed size chunks (of, say, 4 KB), and a **CARD TABLE** is maintained which is a bit map, representing one bit for each of these memory chunks. Whenever an inter-generational pointer is created, the corresponding bit in the card table for this block is marked dirty. In the next GC cycle, all the objects in these dirty memory blocks are considered as virtual roots.

| *type* | Tracing : Identifies live objects. However does not need to scan all generations or entire heap at once.|
| *phases* | Minor(Young collect), Major (Tenured Collect) : Including per-generation algorithms: Mark,Copy etc. Java has 5 gens |
| *moving* | yes (can't be used for languages exposing pointer semantics)|
| *allocator* | per-generation (free-list or bump-allocator)|
| *issues* | write-barrier overhead (all store-pointer operations have to be tracked) |
