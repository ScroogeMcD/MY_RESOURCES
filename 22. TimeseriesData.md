# Time Series Data

## Metrics, tags
A timeseries is identified by the name of the metrics, and some corresponding tags. This unique combination of metrics and tags is provided an id.

|TimeseriesId|metric|Tag1|Tag2|Tag3|
|------------|------|----|----|----|
|ts1|memory.heap|host=host1|app=pricingApp|az=mumbai|
|ts2|memory.heap|host=host1|app=accountingApp|az=singapore|
|ts3|memory.heap|host=host2|app=pricingApp|az=mumbai|


## Storage in Key-Value store (like RocksDB for ex.)
**Key** : It is a concatenation of the timestamp alongiwth with the timeseries id.
**Value** : Instead of tracking each sample (say of seconds granularity) against its own timestamp key, the samples are stored at a slightly higher level, for ex, say a minute, in the image below. Thus each minute bucket will store all the sample of seconds granularity within that minute bucket, alongwith four other measures : **count**, **min**, **max**, **sum**.

Since these updates will be done in memory, it will be fast, then once the minute has elapsed, it can later on be flushed onto disk.
