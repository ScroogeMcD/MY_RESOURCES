## Column Store Databases

A column store database stores data using a column oriented model.   
Column store databases use a concept called '*keyspace*'. This is analogous to *schema* in relational databases. Keyspace contains column families.    
Similarly there are '*Column Families*' which are analogous to tables in relational databases.

**keyspace** -> **schema**   
**column family** -> **table**
