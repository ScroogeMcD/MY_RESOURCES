## FOREX or Foreign Exchange

Forex involves exchanging one currency pair in return of the other. For example, consider the following GBP/USD currency pair.

**Base Currency** is the currency listed first in a currency pair, whereas **Quote Currency** is the currency listed second. This represents how much one unit of the base currency is worth in the quote currency. For ex GBP/USD = 1.33 means 1.33 units of USD is required to buy one unit of GBP.
