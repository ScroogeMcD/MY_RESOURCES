## System Programming

* Physical memory is divided into two spaces : one in which the user programs are loaded - called **user space** -, and one where the operating system itself is 
stored - called **system space**.
* The **kernel** has full access to all of the hardware attached to the system. User programs interact with the hardware indirectly through the kernel. The kernel
maintains various system resources (includes many different data structures), that keep track of I/O, memory and device usage etc.
* There are two different methods by which a program can make requests for services from the kernel :
  * by making a **system call** to a function built directly into the kernel
  * by calling a higer level **library routine** that makes use of this call
* The C library provides wrappers for almost all system calls, and these usually have the same name as the call itself.
* There may be some system calls which do not have wrappers in the library, and for these the programmer has no other choice but to invoke the system call with a 
  special function named **syscall()** passing in the system call's identification number and arguments. Every system call has a unique number associated to it 
  (mostly present in the file <sys/syscall.h>).
