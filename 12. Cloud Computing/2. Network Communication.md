## HTTP

![HTTP_Request_Structure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13499858/122881241-911b4b80-d358-11eb-8555-98bfd419922d.png)

HTTP 1.1
* A connection needs to be created before the start of the communication.
* Unless the response of a previous request is received, the next request cannot be sent.
* Once the response is received, the next request can use the same connection, and save the overhead of conenction creation.

## HTTP vs TCP
* HTTP is stateless, while TCP is stateful.
* In every HTTP call, we recreate the TCP connection.
