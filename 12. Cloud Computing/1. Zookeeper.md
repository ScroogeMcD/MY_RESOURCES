ZNode's properties :
* Hybrid between a file and a directory
  * Znodes can store data inside (like a file)
  * Znodes can have children znodes (like a directory)
* Two types of Znodes :
  * Persistent - persists between sessions
  * Ephemeral - is deleted when the session ends

Some useful zookeeper commands [from within zookeeper installation's bin directory]:
* **zkServer.sh start** => starts server on the port specified in the default config file
* **zkCli.sh** => start a shell that connect to the zk server started above
* ls, create [path] [data], deleteall [path], get -s [path]
