## Problem 2 : Smallest subarray with a given sum
**Problem Statement** : *Given an array of positive numbers, and a postive number S, find the length of smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to S.*

**Solution** :  
- STEP 01 : Starting from first element, keep increasing the window to the right, till you have a subarray with sum >= S. Record its length.
- STEP 02 : Once you have a window of length >= S, keep shrinking it from left, till the sum comes down to less than S.
- STEP 03 : Once the sum of the window is < S, expand the window to the right.

In Steps 02 and 03, whenever you find a window with sum >= S, and lenght smaller than the current minimum length recorded, update the min length, with this window size.
