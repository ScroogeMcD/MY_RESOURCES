# Two Pointers

## Problem 1 : Dutch National Flag OR sorting an array of 0s, 1s and 2s
**Problem Statement** : *Given an array of 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in place.*.  

**Solution** :
- We will keep two pointers *low* and *high*.   
- All elements to the left of *low* will be 0s, and all elements to the right of *high* will be 2s.
- 1s would be between low and high.
- We will start iterating from index 0, till the time the iterator reaches high, and keep swapping elements either with low or high
